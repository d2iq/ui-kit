# BadgeButton Button

BadgeButton Buttons are a lightweight method of annotating or labeling content. The font-size and line-height of a badgeButton inherit from that of it’s parent’s properties.

### BadgeButton States

You may wish to display more than the single badgeButton type, either to create separation in the importance of various actions or to communicate the state of an action or form badgeButton states make this super easy.
