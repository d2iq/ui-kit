# Design Tokens

Design tokens are a set of key-value pairs that describe the simplest attributes of UI Kit's visual design. For example: colors, spacing sizes, and font weights.

## Docs

The Markdown files in this directory are intended to be a listing of all available design tokens. These docs **do not** have any usage guidelines. At the time of this writing, we do not yet have usage guidelines for any of our design tokens.

For technical documentation, please refer to `packages/design-tokens/README`.
