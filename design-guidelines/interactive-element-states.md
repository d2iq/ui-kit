# Interactive Component States

States communicate the different statuses of UI components to the user, including permission, availability, and interactivity. Different states of components are primarily distinguished by different visual representations of the component to provide clear affordances to the user regarding the current status.

## Common interaction subjects

- Actions
  - For example: buttons
- Selectable items
  - For example: items in a list of selectable options
- Data inputs
  - For example: a text input

## States: Ready to receive input

### Hover

Styling a component when it is hovered by a cursor indicates that a component can be interacted with. If a component is normally interactive but is currently disabled, it should not be styled on hover. For example: a dropdown menu item gets a different background color when it is hovered unless it is disabled.

In addition to updating a component's style when it is hovered, it is also a good idea to update the cursor style to match the purpose of the component. For example: showing a resize cursor when hovering a drag handle that is used to resize a table column.

Do not remove the browser's default hover styles unless you're overriding them with custom hover styles.

### Focus

Styling a component when it receives focus indicates that a component is active and ready to receive input. If a component is normally interactive but is currently disabled, it should not receive focus. For example: a text input gets a new border color when it receives focus.

Focus styles can match the hover styles, but it's also okay to have different styles to indicate hover and focus. It's also acceptable to have different focus styles for different input devices. For example: our button components have focus styles that only appear when the button is focused using the keyboard.

Do not remove the browser's default focus styles unless you're overriding them with custom focus styles.

### Active

A component can be styled to indicate it is actively receiving input such as a mouse click or pressing the Tab key to focus the input. If a component is normally interactive but is currently disabled, it should not receive active styles. For example: when a button is clicked, the background color is changed while the mouse is pressed down.

Do not remove the browser's default active styles unless you're overriding them with custom active styles.

### Selected

If a component has been toggled to an "on" state, or picked from a list of options, it should be styled to visually indicate its selected state. For example: a selected dropdown menu item gets a different background color when it is selected.

If there is another affordance to indicate the selected state, such as a checkmark or a text label, additional styles are optional. For example: a checkbox label does not need any visual design changes because there is a checkmark that indicates whether or not it is selected.

## States: Not ready to receive input

### Loading

If an action will not be completed immediately, the user should be reassured that their action has not failed but it is still in progress. The component that triggers the action should be disabled to avoid re-starting the process. If the action has a label, the label may be updated to communicate what's happening. For example: changing a button's label from "Save" to "Saving...". Loading states should not block interaction with unrelated components.

### Disabled

Use a disabled state when a component cannot be selected or interacted with, but there is something that can be done by the current user to enable the component.

It should be obvious that something is disabled before a user tries to interact with it.

Disabled components should not provide any feedback when they're clicked.

Disabled components should not be keyboard-navigable unless a tooltip is displayed when the disabled component is focus.

#### When to disable a component

An interactive component should be disabled when:

- there is something a user can do in their current session to enable the component. For exapmle: disabling a button to add items to a list when a user has reached the maximum number of items. The button would become enabled after one or more existing items are removed.
- something in progress needs to be completed before the component can be enabled. For example: disabling a submit button until the backend has sent an error or success response.
- the component becomes disabled based on something else in the app state. For example: an "Edit" button is disabled until the backend has sent a response affirming that the subject is ready to be edited.
- hiding the component might confuse users, or the user might have a strong expectation to execute that action. For example: if we have a list of items with dropdown menus, it could be confusing to hide a dropdown menu option in some of the items, but show it in others.
- we want to show that a feature that is on a product's roadmap. For example: disabling a button to select a cloud provider we don't support yet, but we want users to know that we plan to support it in the future.

#### Make it clear why something is disabled

If a component is disabled but still visible, don't force users to interpret why the component is disabled. Provide contextual information to explain why the component cannot be interacted with.

Suggested patterns:

- displaying instruction text below the affected section's nearest header
- displaying an explanation as caption text near the disabled component
- displaying tooltip when hovering or focusing the disabled component

### Read-only

A read-only state is similar to a disabled state, except the content of a read-only input is relevant to completing the current task. Use a read-only state when the value of an input is going to be used, but the input cannot be changed directly. For example: if we automatically generate a token based on other input values, but the token value cannot be directly edited by the user.

To help users understand what they can edit and what they cannot edit, read-only components should not be styled like their interactive counterparts. For example: a read-only text input should not simply look like a regular text input that doesn't respond to interaction.

### Hidden

Hiding components is appropriate when a user does not have permission nor expectation to view and interact with specific content. Hiding such components improves security and reduces visual clutter on the page and the cognitive load on a user because there is less information to process.

#### When to hide a component:

- it meets all of the following criteria. For example: hiding a "Create" button when a user does not have permission to create that type of object.
  - cannot be selected or interacted with
  - there is nothing a user can do to enable the component
  - the user has no expectation that they should be able to interact with that component
- the component toggles a menu of options where all options are hidden
