# Badges

Badges are a lightweight method of annotating or labeling content. The font-size and line-height of a badge inherit from that of it’s parent’s properties.

### Badge States

You may wish to display more than the single badge type, either to create separation in the importance of various actions or to communicate the state of an action or form badge states make this super easy.

| With Icon | If need be we can add icons and tooltips to add further context.                                              | ![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos-labs/ui-kit/master/packages/badge/assets/badge-icon.png)    |
