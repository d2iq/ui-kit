# Breadcrumb

The `Breadcrumb` component is used for navigating within sections of an app. It communicates information hierarchy and helps users follow the path they took to get to their current screen, and provides a way to navigate back to parent screens.

We style our breadcrumbs with large text because they're used to label pages in the PageHeader component. When at the top level of a section, a breadcrumb will just appear like a regular page title.
