# Card
Cards are used to visually group related content. Cards can be used to make it easier for users to scan a view.

## Aspect ratio
Sometimes we want a card's size to obey a specific aspect ratio. When an aspect ratio is defined, the card's width and height will always follow that proportion unless the content is too high: in which case the card's height will increase.

## ButtonCard
A `ButtonCard` component is used to render a card that a user can interact with. It has all of the same properties as a `Card` component, but can also appear in an "on", "off", or "disabled" state.
