# ClickToCopyButton

The `ClickToCopyButton` component is used to provide users with an easy way to copy text to their clipboard, which is often used for code snippets or configuration content.

This component provides a button that can be clicked, and once clicked, it will copy the text that has been passed to it as props.
If nothing is provided to the `children` prop can be customized, the button will display as a clipboard icon.
