# CodeSnippet

The `CodeSnippet` component is used to visually display code, it uses a monospace font to make it easier to read and distinguish. It provides an optional `textToCopy` property that can be used to copy the code to the clipboard, and also allows for a custom `onCopy` function to be executed after the text has been copied.
