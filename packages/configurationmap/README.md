# ConfigurationMap

The ConfigurationMap component renders a two column table-like representation of a data in a `key: value` form.

## HashMap

A HashMap component takes an object through the `hash` prop and renders the data in the form of a ConfigurationMap. This component has no design differences, it's just provided for developer convenience.
