# ConfigurationMap

The ConfigurationMap component renders a two column table-like representation of a data in a `key: value` form.

## HashMap

The `HashMap` component is a convenience component that takes an object through the hash prop and renders the data in the form of a ConfigurationMap. There are no design differences between the two components.
