# DonutChart Name

Donut charts are good for showing percentage or proportional data. They're just like a pie chart, but with an empty middle section.

## Best practices:

### Do:

- Use a donut chart to compare parts of a whole
- Use the `label` and `text` props to display helpful information
- Use a legend to label your segment colors when there is more than one piece of data being displayed

### Don't:

- Use a donut chart if a segment of your data can exceed 100% of the total
- Use a donut chart if a segment of your data can be a negative value
- Use a donut chart if you're comparing many pieces of data - it can get visually busy and difficult to comprehend
