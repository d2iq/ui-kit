# DonutChart Name

The DonutChart component is used to display data in a circular chart with a hole in the center. It is typically used to represent data as parts of a whole, where each section of the chart represents a percentage of the total. The DonutChart is similar to a pie chart, but with the center removed.

## Best practices

### Do

- Use a donut chart to compare parts of a whole
- Use the `label` and `text` props to display helpful information
- Use a legend to label your segment colors when there is more than one piece of data being displayed

### Don't

- Use a donut chart if a segment of your data can exceed 100% of the total
- Use a donut chart if a segment of your data can be a negative value
- Use a donut chart if you're comparing many pieces of data - it can get visually busy and difficult to comprehend

## When to use a Donut Chart?

A DonutChart can be useful when you want to show how a set of data is distributed across multiple categories. It is also effective when you want to highlight the contribution of each category to the total, and when comparing the relative size of each category is important.

However, it is important to note that donut charts can be difficult to read when there are too many categories, or when the differences in sizes of the categories are small. In these cases, it may be better to use a different chart type, such as a bar chart or a stacked bar chart.

When using a DonutChart, it is important to ensure that the colors used for each category are easily distinguishable from one another, and that they are presented in a logical order. It is also important to include labels or tooltips that provide information about each category, and the percentage that it represents of the total.

Overall, a DonutChart can be an effective way to display data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand way, as long as it is used appropriately and presented clearly.
