# DropdownMenu

A dropdown toggles an overlay menu of actions. It appears as a result of a user interacting with some trigger (usually a button or icon) to open the menu.

Dropdown menus can be opened and navigated via cursor and keyboard.

## DropdownMenu triggers
By default, use one of the dropdown button components (e.g.: `PrimaryDropdownButton`) as the dropdown trigger.

If you're not using a button as your dropdown trigger, be sure whatever you use looks like something the user is supposed to interact with.

## Icons and avatars in items
Dropdown menu items can display an icon or avatar before or after the menu item text. By default, the avatar or icon is sized at `iconSizeXs`.

## Disabled menu items
TODO: Collaborate with the design team to decide on some guidelines for disabled items. For example: when should we render a disabled item instead of not showing the item in the dropdown at all?

## Do's and Dont's

### Do
- Use concise language to improve scannability
- Use verbs for menu items that are actions
- Avoid hiding actions in dropdowns when possible - especially critical actions

### Don't
- Use icons or avatars that are different sizes in the same dropdown section
- Use only icons or avatars as menu item content
- Make menu item content too complicated. The shorter and simpler, the better
- Use a dropdown menu in a form to replace a `<select>` dropdown. Use the `SelectInput` component instead
