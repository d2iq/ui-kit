# Dropdownable

Dropdownable is a component that renders its children and optionally a dropdown overlay relative to them. (Think select list, multiselect, combox box). Unlike those examples, it does not prescribe any particular overlay style or content. Dropdownable simply facilitates a dropdownable UI.

## Display Behavior

Dropdown contents are eagarly added to the DOM off-screen and repositioned relative to the Dropdown children when opened. Dropdown contents are dismissed when the user clicks outside the dropdown.
