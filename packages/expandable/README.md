# Expandable

The Expandable component is used to show or hide content on a page, allowing users to interact with it only when they need to. It's a simple and useful way to declutter your UI and make it more user-friendly.

You should use the Expandable component when you have a lot of content to show but don't want to overwhelm the user with too much information at once. The component allows you to show a summary or a preview of the content and provide an option for users to expand it when they want to see more details.

To use the Expandable component, simply pass the content you want to show or hide as its child component. You can customize the label that triggers the expansion of the content by passing a `label` prop.

Note that the Expandable component is not suitable for critical information that should always be visible to the user. Additionally, make sure that the label is clear and descriptive enough so that users know what content they're expanding.
