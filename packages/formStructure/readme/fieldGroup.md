# FieldGroup

A `FieldGroup` may be used to visually group 2 or more fields that are closely related. For example: a number input followed by a select dropdown containing possible memory units.

Fields are arranged in a row, but should be switched to a column for smaller viewport widths to avoid rendering fields that are too narrow.

Avoid putting too many fields in a field group, ideally no more than 3. We don't want users to think too hard about how each field is related.
