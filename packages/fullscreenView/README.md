# FullscreenView

The `FullscreenView` component should be used when we want to bring the user into a more focused flow that does not have parts of the `AppChrome` layout such as the header or sidebar.

The `FullscreenModal` component can be used instead in cases where we still want access to other content from the same page but still want a focused view.
