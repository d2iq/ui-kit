# Icon

Icons can live within other components, such as buttons. They should take on the text color of that component.
Icons have a default color, but can be styled with any color.
Icons have a default size, but can be resized to any of the predetermined icon sizes from our design tokens.

## Icon sets

### System Icons

System icons are glyphs we can use as stand alone actions or to support labels in actions.

### Product Icons

Product icons are used to represent and convey the DC/OS suite features and capabilities (e.g. Universe, Network, Security, etc...). Unlike DC/OS system icons, product icons are not meant to be paired with actions.

The primary purpose of product icons is way-finding, context, and messaging. Each product icon is unique in its own right, though all product icons share a similar artistic style that is consistent with the DC/OS product look & feel.
