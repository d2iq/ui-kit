## System Icons

System icons are glyphs we can use as stand alone actions or to support labels in actions.

## Product Icons

Product icons are used to represent and convey the D2iQ suite features and capabilities. Unlike D2iQ system icons, product icons are not meant to be paired with actions.

The primary purpose of product icons is way-finding, context, and messaging. Each product icon is unique in its own right, though all product icons share a similar artistic style that is consistent with the D2iQ product look & feel.
