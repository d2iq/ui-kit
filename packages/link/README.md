# Link

A `Link` renders a styled anchor tag that typically appears inline in a block of text.

When there is a call-to-action that is a link, use one of the button components (e.g.: `SecondaryButton`) and pass the `url` prop.

## ResetLink

The `ResetLink` component lets engineers build components that should behave like a link without being styled like a link. For example: sidebar navigation items (see the `SidebarItem` component).
