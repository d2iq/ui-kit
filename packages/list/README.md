# Lists

Lists are used to display a collection of items in a vertical format. There are two types of list style options a plain vertical list or a bordered list with a border between each list item.

## List

The `List` component renders a plain vertical list of items. Each item is rendered as a simple text string. The `markerStyle` prop allows for customization of the marker shown to the left of each list item.

## BorderedList

The BorderedList component renders a list of items with a border and a gutter between each item. This type of list can be useful for displaying collections of items that need to be separated visually.

To use the BorderedList component, simply pass a list of items as children to the component. Each item will be rendered with a border and a gutter between it and the next item.
