# RadioInput

The `RadioInput` component is a grouped field that allows users to select a single value from a list of options. Unlike the `SelectInput`, all of the options are visible without opening a dropdown.

## Best Practices

- Limit the number of radio inputs in a group to 12 or fewer. If you need more than 12 radio inputs, consider using a `SelectInput` instead.
- Clearly label radio inputs to ensure that users understand the meaning of each option.
- Use vertical alignment for radio buttons, unless horizontal layout is more appropriate.

### When to opt for a radio input?

Use radio inputs when the user needs to select a single option from a list of mutually exclusive options. Radio inputs are useful when the user needs to make a single choice from a set of options that cannot be combined. For example, a user might choose a single payment method from a list of options.

Use radio inputs when the list of options is short and easily scannable. Radio inputs are most effective when the list of options is short and can be quickly scanned by the user. Longer lists may overwhelm the user and make it difficult for them to make a decision. If you have a longer list of options, consider using a dropdown or breaking the options up into smaller groups.

Use radio inputs when it's important to show all options at once.
