# SlideToggle

The SlideToggle component is a good choice when you want to give the user an easy way to toggle something on or off, such as a setting. They are commonly used for settings such as turning on/off a dark mode or enabling/disabling a feature.

As a best practice, it is recommended to use a SlideToggle instead of a checkbox when you want to provide the user with a more visual and interactive way to toggle an option on or off. The sliding animation adds a bit of polish to the interaction and can provide better feedback to the user about the state of the toggle.

However, it's important to keep in mind that SlideToggles are not appropriate for all use cases. If you have a long list of options, it's generally better to use a different component, such as a dropdown menu or a toggle switch. Additionally, if the option you're providing isn't binary (i.e., it has more than two states), a SlideToggle may not be the best choice. In those cases, consider using a different type of control that can better represent the different states.
