# Stack

The `Stack` component is a layout utility that creates a vertical stack of elements, separated by a specified amount of space. It is useful for creating a list of items that need to be vertically separated by a consistent amount of space, or for creating a vertical layout for any group of elements.

The `Stack` component takes in several props to customize its behavior. The `spacingSize` prop sets the amount of space between items in the stack, which can be set to a default value or can be adjusted based on viewport width breakpoints. The `tag` prop determines what type of HTML tag should be used to render the component, with a default value of `div`. The `children` prop is used to provide the elements to be stacked.

The `Stack` component is a useful tool for creating vertical layouts with consistent spacing between elements.
