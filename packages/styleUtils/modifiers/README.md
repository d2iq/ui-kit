# Modifiers

Modifiers are a set of style utility components that can be used to apply styles to other components or elements.

## Box

The `Box` component is a general-purpose style utility component that can be used to contain elements and apply various styles. It can be used to add padding, margins, borders, background color, and other style properties to a component or element.

## BorderedBox

The `BorderedBox` component applies default border styles to a component or element, and it provides options to customize the border properties. This can be useful when you want to add a border to a component or element, but you don't want to define all the border properties manually.

## SpacingBox

The `SpacingBox` component applies spacing based on the spacing values defined in our design tokens. This component should be primarily used to wrap children components or elements that need spacing applied to them. It can help ensure consistency in the spacing between elements throughout an application.
