# Textarea

A `Textarea` is used to input a large amount of text data in a form field. They're very similar to a regular text input, but they support multiple lines of text.

By default, the Textarea height is set to accommodate 3 lines of text. You can adjust this by setting the rows prop to give users a hint of how much content the field expects.
