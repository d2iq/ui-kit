# Tooltip

Tooltips provide an additional explanation about a UI element when hovered or has focus.

## Best practices:

### Do:

- Use Tooltips to show additional information when hovering or focusing a button that is just an icon with no text.
- Use Tooltips to explan why a UI element is disabled when possible.
- Use brief and concise language for Tooltip content.

### Don't:

- Use Tooltips to display critical information. Ideally, tooltips are only used for "nice-to-know" information.
- Design interfaces that rely heavily on Tooltips to help the user complete their task. This is a sign that the design needs to be more clear.

### Usage with a form field

If you want to provide information about what input the field expects, use hint text below the field.
If you want to provide an additional explanation about the field, use a Tooltip. Usually, Tooltips are triggered in form fields by an icon in the field's label.
