# Typeahead

The `Typeahead` component is used for displaying a searchable list of items for users to select from as they type into a text input field. It is built using the Downshift library and can be used in scenarios where a user needs to search for and select one or multiple items from a list.

It is a form input component that provides users with a list of suggestions that match the characters they have typed in the input field. The component is typically used to help users quickly and easily find the value they are looking for in a large dataset. When a suggestion is selected, the corresponding value is returned as the input value.

The Typehead can be customized in several ways, including changing the maximum height of the suggestion menu, pre-filling the input field with a selected value, using a callback function to handle selection events, enabling multi-select, adding disabled items to the list, and filtering the list while typing.

The Typeahead is typically used in situations where the user needs to input a value that matches one or more predefined options. It can be particularly useful when there is a long list of options to choose from, as it allows the user to quickly filter and select the desired option.

Typeahead components are commonly used in search boxes or when entering data that requires a specific format, such as selecting a location, a product, or a tag. They can also be useful in forms where a user needs to select an option from a predefined list, but where the list is too long to display all the options at once.
